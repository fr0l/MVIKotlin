## Overview

### What is MVI
MVI stands for Model-View-Intent. It is an architectural pattern that utilizes unidirectional data flow. The data circulates between `Model` and `View` only in one direction - from `Model` to `View` and from `View` to `Model`.

### What is MVIKotlin
MVIKotlin is a Kotlin Multiplatform framework that provides a way of (not only) writing
shared code using MVI pattern. It also includes powerful debug tools like
logging and time travel. The main functionality of the framework does not depend on any
reactive nor coroutines library. Extensions for [Reaktive](https://github.com/badoo/Reaktive)
and for [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) libraries are 
provided as separate modules.

#### Responsibility
MVIKotlin does not bring or enforce any particular architecture. Its responsibility can be described as follows:

- To provide a single source of truth for `State` (the scope is not defined, it can be a whole app, a screen, a feature, or a part of a feature);
- To provide an abstraction for UI with efficient updates (however this is not obligatory, you can use whatever you want);
- To provide lifecycle aware connections (binding) between inputs and outputs (again this is not obligatory in any way).

Everything else is out of scope of the library, there are no definitions for "screens", "features", "modules", etc. Also, no particular reactive framework is enforced/exposed. This gives a lot of flexibility:

- MVIKotlin can be introduced incrementally (e.g. you can start using it in a small feature and then expand gradually);
- You can use/experiment with different architectures, approaches and/or libraries for navigation, UI, modularization, etc;
- Use whatever reactive framework you like or don't use it at all.

You can find one of the architecture options in the [samples](https://github.com/arkivanov/MVIKotlin/tree/master/sample). Again, this is just an example of one possible solution.

## Setup
Recommended minimum Gradle version is 5.3. Please read first the documentation about
[metadata publishing mode](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/building-mpp-with-gradle.html#experimental-metadata-publishing-mode).

Add Bintray repository into your root build.gradle file:
```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url  "https://dl.bintray.com/arkivanov/maven"
    }
}
```

There are a number of modules published:
- `mvikotlin` - core interfaces and functionality (multiplatform)
- `mvikotlin-main` - the main module with the default `Store` implementation (mutiplatform)
- `mvikotlin-logging` - logging functionality (mutiplatform)
- `mvikotlin-timetravel` - time travel feature (mutiplatform)
- `mvikotlin-extensions-reaktive` - extensions set for Reaktive library (multiplatform)
- `mvikotlin-extensions-coroutines` - extensions set for coroutines (multiplatform)
- `rx` - a tiny module with abstractions over rx and coroutines (multiplatform)
- `androidx-lifecycle-interop` - interoperability between Androidx and MviKotlin Lifecycles (Android)

Add required modules to your module`s build.gradle file:
```groovy
implementation "com.arkivanov.mvikotlin:<module-name>:<version>"
```
